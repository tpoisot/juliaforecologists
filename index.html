<p>The <a href="http://julialang.org/">Julia</a> programming language is a new initiative to provide an efficient, easy to write, high-performance language for users of computing environments. Julia is simple to learn, easy to write, and runs extremely fast.</p>
<p>Ecology, evolution, and many other life sciences are dominated by R, and to a lesser extent, Python. Both are excellent languages. Julia is a good complement to both. It is less statistic-oriented than R, and built on modern principles. It is also <em>really</em> easy to learn.</p>
<h1 id="what-will-i-find-here">What will I find here?</h1>
<p>More or less, an introduction to Julia, using examples from ecology. There will be a lot of code, covering things from dynamical models, to data analysis, to parallel computing.</p>
<p>Every &quot;chapter&quot; can be covered in between 10 and 30 minutes, and there is no assumption that they are going to be read in order.</p>
<h1 id="what-do-i-need">What do I need?</h1>
<p>Having the latest stable version of Julia would be fine. You can get it from the <a href="http://julialang.org/downloads/">download page</a> of the Julia project. On most GNU/Linux distributions, you can install it using your usual package manager.</p>
<p>If you don't want to install anything on your machine, I recommend you use <a href="http://www.juliabox.org/">JuliaBox</a>. It is a free cloud-based service in which you can run Julia code in an interactive environment.</p>
<p>If you are looking for resources, there are two pages you should bookmark. The first is <a href="http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/julia/">Learn Julia in Y minutes</a>. It is a very good overview of the language. The second is <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8252984/julia.html">The Fast Track to Julia</a>. Both would be good things to keep around when reading this document.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://julia.readthedocs.org/en/stable/">official documentation</a> is also excellent, and remarkably easy to read. The <a href="http://www.stat.wisc.edu/~bates/JuliaForRProgrammers.pdf">Julia for R programmers</a> by Douglas Bates is also an excellent overview of how R and Julia have complementary strengths.</p>
<p>What you should probably <em>not</em> read is the countless number of &quot;R is better than Julia&quot;, &quot;Julia is better than R&quot;, &quot;R is better than Python&quot;, &quot;Python is barely better than pulling out your own teeth with a rusty plier&quot; threads. Very few are about the qualities of the languages themselves; they instead tend to be about people finding justifications for not learning new things. Languages are tools. Find one you know how to use.</p>
<h1 id="list-of-chapters">List of chapters</h1>
<p>At all times, these chapters can be accessed from the navigation bar at the top of the page.</p>
<dl>
<dt><a href="01_primer.html">1</a> A Julia primer</dt>
<dd>This chapter is a general purpose introduction to both the Julia language, and some of the writing conventions in this document.
</dd>
<dt><a href="02_competition.html">2</a> Models of competition</dt>
<dd>This chapter uses models of intraspecific and interspecific competitions to present the declaration of functions, loops, and accessing parts of arrays.
</dd>
<dt><a href="03_leslie.html">3</a> Leslie matrices</dt>
<dd>This chapters uses Leslie matrices to present some of the linear algebra abilities of Julia.
</dd>
<dt><a href="04_glvm.html">4</a> Generalized Lotka-Volterra model</dt>
<dd>This chapters will use some points from chapter 2 and 3, to discuss how to make Julia code <em>fast</em>, and how to declare macros.
