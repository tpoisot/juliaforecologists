# Why Julia?

The [Julia][julia] programming language is a new initiative to provide an
efficient, easy to write, high-performance language for users of computing
environments. Julia is simple to learn, easy to write, and runs extremely fast.

# What will I find here?

More or less, an introduction to Julia, using examples from ecology. There will
be a lot of code, covering things from dynamical models, to data analysis, to
parallel computing.

Every "chapter" can be covered in between 10 and 30 minutes, and there is no
assumption that they are going to be read in order.

# List of chapters

At all times, these chapters can be accessed from the navigation bar at the top
of the page.

[1][ch1] A Julia primer
: This chapter is a general purpose introduction to both the Julia language, and
some of the writing conventions in this document.

[2][ch2] Models of competition
: This chapter uses models of intraspecific and interspecific competitions to
present the declaration of functions, loops, and accessing parts of arrays.

[3][ch3] Leslie matrices
: This chapters uses Leslie matrices to present some of the linear algebra
abilities of Julia.

[4][ch4] Generalized Lotka-Volterra model
: This chapters will use some points from chapter 2 and 3, to discuss how to
make Julia code *fast*, and how to declare macros.
